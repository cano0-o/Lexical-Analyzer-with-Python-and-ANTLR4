# Lexical-Analyzer-with-Python-and-ANTLR4
This project implements a lexical analyzer developed in Python using ANTLR4 to identify and categorize tokens from source code. The analyzer processes a given file, recognizes keywords, operators, delimiters, and comments, and preserves the original structure by replacing block comments with blank lines.
